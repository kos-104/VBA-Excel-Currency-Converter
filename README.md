This Excel Currency Converter, developed with VBA, is designed to process and retrieve currency information.  It features complex event handling, using advanced techniques like custom events and event-trapping to ensure smooth communication between components. It uses an object-oriented approach, incorporating class modules that keep the code organized and encapsulated. Robust error-handling captures expected and (most) unexpected missteps. The form seeks to be intuitive, allowing users to launch the form quickly and access scrollable currency dropdown-menus with varied sorting options. It also includes an expandable/collapsible interactive calendar for selecting dates and tools for analyzing currency trends over the last 30 days. Users get real-time feedback with the form, and can cancel a process and/or get partial results where available. Many API calls are used, including some that enable the form to be positioned on any cell worksheet and others enabling the user to adjust the size of the userform (along with it controls).

In the 2nd version (Curr Conv UF+++++707_275 Safeguard107+), we've increased the sophistication of the design. This version displays several improvements including greater demonstrations of encapsulation, refactoring, and modularity. It employs better usage of private variables and specific subroutines, enhancing encapsulation by protecting internal states and reducing outside dependencies. This contrasts with the earlier version (92), which, while implementing some refactoring and modularity, relied somewhat more on global variables, leading to increased coupling. The latest versionâ€™s procedures are more focused, which simplify testing and reuse - whereas the original combined larger responsibilities within single procedures, making maintenance more complex.

Furthermore, Version 107 advances in event handling by shifting from WithEvents objects to custom events - promoting greater flexibility and decoupling event sources from handlers. This version leverages OOP principles like inheritance/polymorphism more readily, with class modules and custom types encapsulating data and behavior. This is complemented by the intentional use of properties over public variables, enabling data hiding and validation, thereby maintaining data integrity and control. Version 107 also integrates many code-optimizing suggestions provided by the Rubberduck VBA add-in.
