This Excel Currency Converter, developed with VBA, is designed to process and retrieve currency information.  It features complex event handling, using advanced techniques like custom events and event-trapping to ensure smooth communication between components. It uses an object-oriented approach, incorporating class modules that keep the code organized and encapsulated. Robust error-handling captures expected and (most) unexpected missteps. The form seeks to be intuitive, allowing users to launch the form quickly and access scrollable currency dropdown-menus with varied sorting options. It also includes an expandable/collapsible interactive calendar for selecting dates and tools for analyzing currency trends over the last 30 days. Users get real-time feedback with the form, and can cancel a process and/or get partial results where available. Many API calls are used, including some that enable the form to be positioned on any cell worksheet and others enabling the user to adjust the size of the userform (along with it controls).

In the 2nd version (Curr Conv UF+++++707_275 Safeguard97), we've moved to a more loosely-coupled design. While trapping userform/class events directly is still used, it's applied more strategically, and the raising of special custom events is deployed instead to do more of the heavy lifting. This reduces dependencies between components, making the code less intricately tied together. By abstracting interactions with userform controls, the code becomes more modular and isolated, and thereby more refined. This new version also employs constants for better readability and to minimize magic numbers.
