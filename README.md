This Excel Currency Converter, developed with VBA, is designed to retrieve and process currency information.  It features complex event handling, using advanced techniques like custom events and event-trapping to ensure smooth communication between components. It uses an object-oriented approach, incorporating class modules that keep the code organized and encapsulated. Robust error-handling captures expected and (most) unexpected slips. The form seeks to be intuitive, allowing users to launch the form quickly and access scrollable currency dropdown menus with varied sorting options. It also includes an expandable/collapsible interactive calendar for selecting dates and tools for analyzing currency trends over the last 30 days. Users get real-time feedback with the form, and can cancel a process and/or get partial results where available.

In the 2nd version (Curr Conv UF+++++707_275 Safeguard95), we've moved to a more loosely-coupled design. While trapping userform/class events directly is still used, it's applied more strategically, and the raising of many special custom events is instead deployed to do more of the heavy lifting. This reduces dependencies between components, making the code less intricately tied together. By abstracting interactions with userform controls, the code becomes more modular and isolated, and thereby more refined.
